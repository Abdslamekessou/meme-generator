# Meme Generator (React + Vite)

A simple meme generator app built with React and Viteâ€”perfect for practicing React fundamentals.

## Features
- Built with React and modern tooling (Vite)
- Minimal setup supports hot module replacement and ESLint
- Includes basic React component structure under `src/`

## Learning Focus
Designed to give you hands-on experience with React hooks, especially `useEffect`:
- Load meme templates via API or static data
- Use `useEffect` to fetch data on component mount
- Manage component state with `useState`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to launch locally

Feel free to extend:
- Add meme template fetching (e.g., from a public API)
- Overlay text on images
- Manage state and side effects using `useState` and `useEffect`
